# From The Developer:

This was an Internview Assignment Project by a company. It was a Backend Position and the project requirement was Backend Only, so you will see very less use of Frontend Technology.

I only worked on the features I was asked as a demonstration for them.

This is not an application to be used publicly. There are many functionalities that could be added. You can use it as a PHP Cheat-Sheet / Reference to code.

## Tips

To use the 'Password Reset' and 'User EMail Verification in Registration' make the following changes :

    Change the website for the Password Reset Link to your own website where you are hosting the app in 'VERIFICATION EMAIL' Section of /forgot/forgotpassword.php and /registration.php.
